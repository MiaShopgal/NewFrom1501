When creating a new project with Xcode 15.0.1, I observed that breakpoints became ineffective when switching to Xcode 15.1 and using the iOS 16.4 simulator for development. 
Breakpoints couldn't halt the execution to view variables. 
If I switch to a simulator other than iOS 16.4, debugging works as expected.
